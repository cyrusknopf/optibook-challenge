# Submission for the Optiver Optibook Challenge at ICHack 2025

We attempted a number of different strategies over the course of the event, some of which worked better than others.

The original code was ran on an EC2 instance which was provided at the event, as well as using the private Optibook Python library. As such this code is not intended to be built or ran.

The challenge consisted of periods of time where there were two markets open at once, and times where a single market was open. We added strategies for both situations, adapting to the market as it moved.
